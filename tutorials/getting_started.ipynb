    "If there are no test errors, build the main executable.\\\n",

    "```make```\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "If everything builds correctly, you can run a simple test using the default parameters.\\\n",

    "This will execute a simple exciton diffusion simulation test, and when it finishes several output files\n",
    "will be created in the project directory. You can quickly check the results in the analysis summary file\n",

    "## Trouble Shooting\n",
    "If  ``` pip install .``` runs, but ```import exm``` returns ```ModuleNotFoundError```, the most likely problem is that your machine has multiple different versions of python, and has installed it in one and is running this notebook in another. Try switching the interpreter with which you're running this notebook. "
